### What I Learned

This project helped me practice:
- Using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Building component-based layouts with React.
- Creating responsive designs for both desktop and mobile devices.

Here is an example of the key code structure:

```jsx
<div className="bg-slate-300 h-screen flex justify-center items-center">
  <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md text-center">
    <img
      src="/images/image-qr-code.png"
      alt="QR Code"
      className="rounded-lg mb-4"
    />
    <h1 className="text-slate-900 text-xl font-bold mb-2">
